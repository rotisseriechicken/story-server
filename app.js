/*
 *    Server architecture explanation
 *
 *      The server has a copy of the client's logic that determine parts of speech, 
 *      word validity (if a word can be submitted and added to the story),
 *      global logic (words inside active quotes bypass grammar and lexicon checks),
 *      and global filtration (slur prevention).
 *
 *      The server also has the master copy of the current story,
 *      and clients assume that the server's copy is the correct one,
 *      not showing their word on screen until it has been emitted by the server.
 *
 *      The packet types are as follows:
 *
 *    SERVER TO CLIENT #############################
 *
 *      c  -  Client connected to server. 
 *            CONTENT:  [The number of the current story,  The current story array, The server version]
 *
 *      +  -  Server submitted word to client. (EMITTED TO ALL!)
 *            CONTENT:  {The word object containing the w packet's word as a string}
 *
 *      f  -  Server stating the story is finished and moving onto the next one. (EMITTED TO ALL!)
 *            CONTENT:  The number of the new story as an integer.
 *
 *      v  -  Update vote score of word. (EMITTED TO ALL!)
 *            CONTENT:  [The index of the word in the story array, & its new score total], both as ints.
 *
 *      q  -  Keep-alive ping. Response is expected within 15,000 MS, or the client has disconnected.
 *            CONTENT:  "."
 *
 *      r  -  Message rejected.
 *            CONTENT:  [Rejection reason as an integer, Words until submittable (incl. 0) as an integer]
 *
 *
 *    CLIENT TO SERVER #############################    
 *
 *      w  -  Client submitted word to server.
 *            CLIENT:    'A-possibly-valid-submission-as-a-string'
 *            RESPONSE:  + packet containing {the word object}
 *
 *      i  -  Declare the client as having "upvoted" a word.
 *            CLIENT:    Index of the word in the story array as an integer.
 *            RESPONSE:  v packet containing [the word index, and new vote total] as integers.
 *
 *      d  -  Declare the client as having "downvoted" a word.
 *            CLIENT:    Index of the word in the story array as an integer.
 *            RESPONSE:  v packet containing [the word index, and new vote total] as integers.
 *
 *      u  -  Declare the client as having "unvoted" a word.
 *            CLIENT:    Index of the word in the story array as an integer.
 *            RESPONSE:  v packet containing [the word index, and new vote total] as integers.
 *
 *      A  -  Keep-alive ping. Response to server's q packet.
 *            CLIENT:    "!"
 *            RESPONSE:  <none>
 *
 *      p  -  Client lite ping. Intended as self-spin.
 *            CLIENT:    <any data>
 *            RESPONSE:  <none>
